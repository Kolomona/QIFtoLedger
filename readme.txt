This is a little ruby utility script that I wrote that will take Bank Of America's (BoA) QIF output file and spit out ledger's data file format

Getting started

Download a QIF file from BoA. There is a sample one included in this release entitled sample.qif

Edit the infilepath and outfilepath variables to point to the files

Edit the @accounts in accounts.rb to match what accounts go with which payee line

Run the file

That's it
